# Software Requirements


## Vision

A lot of people in our society like students and mothers depend on home-made
products as their source of income.
In most cases they have to work from home because of the high cost of real
marketplaces and the long time that will be spent on the process of selling.
Nowadays with the use of e-commerce, the sale of physical products can be
online, which reduces cost and time.
Our web application is for supporting these owners of home-made products to promote their businesses and publish them to the highest percentage of customers. We’re aiming to gather all of these owners in one place that will be interactive and where customers can connect to them in an easy and direct way which will help the owners in understanding customers, marketing their products and achieving a good financial status. We're looking forward being the first platform of its kind in Jordan.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
We achieved high performance by avoiding repetitive and costly work in one file and avoiding overly large single scripts and by modularizing our code. We used mongoDB which is
built on a NoSQL structure that uses a document storage system and that increases
the response time as we put into consideration the best practices of data modeling and designed our schemas and collections in a flexible best-practice way.

2. **Scalability**
Our application takes into consideration various types of businesses not only one type, and
it’s suitable for everyone regarding their lifestyle, purchasing habits or the
demographics. 

3. **Security**
Our application provides secure and trusted authentication using Bearer Authentication which
is a security scheme with type: http and scheme: bearer.
